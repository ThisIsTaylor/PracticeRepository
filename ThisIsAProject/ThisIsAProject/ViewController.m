/*I am adding lots of comments down here so we can play around with it. Woohoo, here goes some more comments. In fact, let me share a monologue
 
 "Not a soul
 But felt a fever of the mad and play'd
 Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
 Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
 Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,
 With hair up-staring,—then like reeds, not hair,—
 Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty
 And all the devils are here." - Ariel
